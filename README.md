# Credit-Card-Default
## Predicting whether a customer will default on his/her credit card

### Problem Description 

The goal of this study is to forecast the likelihood of Taiwanese consumers defaulting on their payments. The predictive accuracy of the anticipated chance of default will yield a more beneficial outcome from the standpoint of risk management than the binary classification of clients as either credible or not. The K-S chart may be used to determine which clients are more likely to miss credit card payments.

### Data Description 

Attribute Information:

This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:

X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.

X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).

X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).

X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).

X5: Age (year).

X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.

X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005.

X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005.

### Objective:

Our project's goal is to forecast which customers may experience default in the months to come. Before we continue, let's take a moment to review the definition of credit card default.

Everyone knows what a credit card is. Instead of using the account holder's cash deposits, this kind of payment card charges are made against a line of credit. Every time a credit card is used for a purchase, a debt is added to the user's account that needs to be paid off every month.

When your credit card payments are far behind due, you are said to be in credit card default.One or two missed credit card payments are not considered defaults. When you don't pay the credit card's Minimum Amount Due for several months in a row, you have a payment default.
